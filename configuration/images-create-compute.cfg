##  CONFIGURATION FILE for COMPUTE IMAGE CREATION
##
################################################################################


# INFORMATION:
# ============
# This file on its own is not enough to configure fully a compute image. It
# creates a basic directory and sets up a few things, so that the real
# configuration can happen later.
# The name of the configuration file that is applied to the newly created
# directory is contained in the variable NODE_IMG_CONFIG.


#===============================================================================
#
#  GENERAL CONFIGURATION

# Directory in which the post scripts are located.
# If it is a relative path, then it is relative to the directory where this file
# resides.

POSTDIR="images"

# Only one post script to run.
# It will call the configuration tool recursively 

POSTLIST=( image-create )

# Path to the new compute image
# If it is a relative path, then it will be relative to $TRIX_IMAGES in
# /etc/trinity.sh.

NODE_IMG_NAME="compute-$(date +%F-%H-%M)"

# Initial RPM with which the image will be kickstarted. This sets the version of
# CentOS that will be installed.
# If not set, all files called "centos-release*.rpm" will be installed (which
# will work only if you have ONE such file in the files folder...).
# The file must be located in the "configuration/images/create-image" directory.

NODE_INITIAL_RPM="centos-release-7-2.1511.el7.centos.2.10.x86_64.rpm"

# Configuration to apply to the newly created image
# Comment out to do only the base OS installation and leave the image
# unconfigured.

# Root password for the newly created image
# If unset or empty, a random one will be generated
